/**********************
SchemeRSS allows a search for local rss/xml files

**********************/

List of file(s):
SchemeRSS.ss    ;;file contains all the methods necessary to run the program


Overall Design:
There are 4 critical functions
processFiles         ;; reads the main rss.txt file and figures out the feed file names
 |
 |--> processFeeds   ;; take a feed file and processes each item
        |
        |--> getAll  ;; gets an item from a feed, and stores title and 
        |            ;;    link separately while processing the description for words
        |
        |--> procDesc ;;given a description, processes it to get individual words and stores in hash table

;; For more details on what each of the function does and how it works, you may look at my comments
;;    I think my comments will make sense

Assumptions:
I have made a few assumptions for this version of the implementation. I assume that a search term is valid only if its length is greater than 2 (at least 3 characters). I also assume that a search term that appears more than 30 times is too common (this is a constant number, so it can be changed any time).

Future Improvements:
In future versions of this program, I would like to take away both the restrictions due to my assumptions. I would like to create a list of common phrases (this, that, is, where, etc.) which is looked up before every insertion. I would like to create a file-selector (browse file dialog box) instead of giving the source file name at the command prompt.



Compiling the program: (No need to compile :))

How to use this program:
->Open SchemeRSS.ss in DrScheme
->Once the file has loaded, Click on "Run"
->at the prompt, type the path to your rss.txt main rss file
  -> the program will prompt you for search words. The prompts are easy to follow from there on.

Thanks.
